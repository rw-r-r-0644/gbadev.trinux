This should be rev. 33 from 07-06-2013

Major changes:

Tweaked some files to get rid of different compiler warnings.
Added a new powerpc_upload_stub_1800_2 that simply turns on the sensorbar.
Added a sync to the powerpc_upload_stub_100 (left the isync in).
Documented the powerpc_upload_stub_100 assembly.


ToDo:

Try to fix the ppc so it proves to be running at least one core.

The stub's should become separate folders with the assembly instructions and their own makefile.
They should become a binary header that can be uploaded to the correct location.

A nandfs file system should be added so that we can get the 00000003.app from nand.

We should find a way to at least reboot so that we can avoid multiple power cyclings to keep our
testers happy.

We should modify nswitch so that it can load our armboot.bin without the need of ios 254

(Those will likely keep us busy for the weekend.  :-) )
