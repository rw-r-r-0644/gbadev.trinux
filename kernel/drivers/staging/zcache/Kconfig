	  Zcache doubles RAM efficiency while providing a significant
	  performance boosts on many workloads.  Zcache uses
	  compression and an in-kernel implementation of transcendent
	  memory to store clean page cache pages and swap in RAM,
	  providing a noticeable reduction in disk I/O.

	  Select the compression method used by zcache.
	  LZO is the default. Snappy compresses a bit worse (around ~2%) but
	  much faster and requires less CPU.
