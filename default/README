COMPILING
---------
DEVKITPRO (ARM/PPC) are required for these builds.
Use ./build.sh. For syntax, type command with no arguments.

NOTES
-----
1. The build process for nswitch is dependant on the outfiles of raw2c, which
   are generated when building armboot. The source for nswitch may/may not
   build properly without first compiling the source for armboot.

2. 'build' is a shell script that will likely only run in unix environments.
   In order to build on Windows, you will likely have to enter each source tree
   individually and build manually.
